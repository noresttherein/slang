/** A boxed variable which value can become frozen at some point, causing all future reads to return the same,
  * frozen value. Its life cycle consists of two phases: during the initialization phase, the variable can
  * be mutated and read just as an unsynchronized [[net.noresttherein.slang.vars.Var Var]] instance, with writes
  * using no synchronization, and reads requiring access to a `@volatile` variable. This phase is not thread-safe.
  * Once the [[net.noresttherein.slang.vars.Freezer#.freeze freeze()]] method is called by any thread,
  * the value of the mutable variable is copied to an 'immutable' `@volatile` field, which is initialized only once
  * and the read-only phase begins. Any future updates to the variable will throw a `IllegalStateException` and
  * the variable will become from this point effectively immutable and thread safe.
  * As an optimization taking advantage of the immutability of the `@volatile` field, its value is then copied
  * to a standard `var` which can be placed in the processor cache, bypassing the `@volatile` access penalty altogether.
  *
  * The difference between `Export[T]` and `Freezer[T]` lies in synchronization: in this class, only the frozen, second
  * phase is thread-safe, and an update might be lost during freezing (it will be neither visible by any future read
  * nor will it fail with an exception). The latter is fully thread-safe in both phases at the cost of more expensive
  * access in the initialization phase.
  * @see [[net.noresttherein.slang.vars.Export Export]]
