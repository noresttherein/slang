/** A simple ephemeral wrapper over a type declaration `T = X`. Together with its super types
  * [[net.noresttherein.slang.typist.TypeDef.InType]] and [[net.noresttherein.slang.typist.TypeDef.OutType]]
  * allows simulation of covariant and contravariant abstract type member declarations. It is roughly equivalent
  * to having the enclosing type accepting a type parameter `X`. Its introduction is motivated by the lack
  * of non-abstract covariant and contravariant type definitions in scala: while similar effect could be had by having
  * the 'interface' traits use type bounds `type T &lt;: X` and `type T &gt;: X`, in such a solution there is a need
  * for separate enclosing class for each desired concrete member type definition. Keeping the type bound `T &lt;: U`
  * in a container makes it instead possible to simply declare `val T :OutType[U] = TypeDef[U]` in the base class
  * and `override val T :OutType[T] = OutType[T]` for `T &lt;: U` as one would with any `val`.
  * There are several reasons why one may choose this unconventional approach over type parameters:
  *   - Reducing clutter of the type signature by removing non-crucial abstract types, especially those being implementation
  *     artifacts;
  *   - Reduces the burden of type constraints required from users of a declaring class: any code unit using a generic type
  *     with bound type parameters needs to explicitly declare those type bounds itself, too. This introduces clutter,
  *     slows development and often poses unnecessary resolvable conflicts from the point of view of client code interested
  *     only in selected fragments of the used interface;
  *   - Helping implicit resolution algorithm to find the correct order of type instantiation: types not present in
  *     the signature are naturally ignored, making the algorithm pick the 'input' types from the point of view of implicits
  *     designed to instantiate an 'output' type with desired properties;
