/** A simple ephemeral wrapper over type declaration `T = X`. Together with its super types
  * [[TypeDef.InType]] and [[TypeDef.OutType]] allows simulation of covariant and contravariant abstract type member
  * declarations. It is roughly equivalent to having the enclosing type accepting a type parameter `X`. Its introduction
  * is motivated by the lack of non-abstract covariant and contravariant type definitions in scala: while similar effect
  * could be had by having the 'interface' traits use type bounds `type T &lt;: X` and `type T &gt;: X`, there is a need
  * for separate enclosing type for each desired concrete member type definition.
  * There are several reasons why one may choose this unconventional approach over type parameters:
  *   - Reducing clutter of the type signature by removing non-crucial abstract types, especially those being implementation
  *     artifacts;
  *   - Reduces the burden of type constraints required from users of a declaring class: any code unit using a generic type
  *     with bound type parameters needs to explicitly declare those type bounds itself, too. This introduces clutter,
  *     slows development and often poses unnecessary resolvable conflicts from the point of view of client code interested
  *     only in selected fragments of the used interface;
  *   - Helping implicit resolution algorithm to find the correct order of type instantiation: types not present in
  *     the signature are naturally ignored, making the algorithm pick the 'input' types from the point of view of implicits
  *     designed to instantiate an 'output' type with desired properties;
