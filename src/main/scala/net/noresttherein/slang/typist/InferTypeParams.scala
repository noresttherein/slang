/** A simple class combining the evidence that `X &lt; T with M with U`, designed to alleviate the limitation
  * of scala type inference of type arguments for generic classes. An implicit instance `InferTypeParams[X, X, X]`
  * is available for any type `X`, which can be additionally shortened with the type alias
  * `Conforms[X, T, U] = InferTypeParams[X, T, U]` declared in the companion object.
  * Given some type constructor `F[X]`, we would often like to declare a generic method with regard to both
  * the specific type of `x :F[X]` and the provided type argument at the same time:
  * {{{
  *     class F[X] { def get :X = ??? }
  *     class X extends F[String]
  *
  *     def m[X <: F[X], X](x :X) :(X, X) = ???
  *
  *     m(new X) //does not compile
  * }}}
  * Unfortunately, the compiler will infer `X, Nothing` as `m`'s type parameters in the call from the above example.
  * This is the more problematic because the need to explicitly provide type arguments prevents any implicit
  * conversion with a similar signature. However, Type inference will work for both the type `X` and the type parameter
  * `String` given to `F`, just not both at the same time:
  * {{{
  *     def m1[X <: F[_]](x :X) = ???
  *     def m2[X](x :F[X]) = ???
  *
  *     m1(new X) //compiles
  *     m2(new X) //compiles
  * }}}
  * By duplicating the occurrence of type `X` in this type signature and having the last type parameter covariant,
  * we can now write:
  * {{{
  *     def m[A, X <: F[X], X](x :A)(implicit help :Conforms[A, X, F[X]]) :(X, X) = help(x) -> help(x).get
  * }}}
  *
  * By convention, the second type parameter should be the complete inferred type, while the third one its upper bound
  * used to capture its type parameters. For convenience, this trait implements `X => T`, so simply declaring an
  * implicit parameter of this type introduces an implicit conversion from the generic, unbound type to the desired one.
  *
  * This inference is guaranteed to work only if the actual parameterized type `T` is a free type variable,
  * that is does not occur in the method signature outside this implicit parameter. The exact algorithm that scala
  * uses for instantiating type parameters is not documented and changes over time, but accepting `InferTypeParameters`
  * as the first implicit parameter generally allows the following implicit parameters to use all the types
  * present in its definition. An occurrence of `T` in the return type of the method accepting this implicit
  * value can often unfortunately likewise result in a failure to infer the type parameters as in the standard scenario.
  * If possible, try to use the type `X` instead, which is always equivalent to `T` for the caller, and use
  * the `_1 : X=:=T` property to cast back the result.
  * @tparam X the type of the formal parameter of the generic method with only concrete bounds, for example
  *           `X &lt: Generic[_]`
  * @tparam T the desired, inferred type of the argument, with bounds dependent on other type parameters,
  *           for example `T &lt;: Generic[X]`. It will always be `T =:= X`.
  * @tparam U the parameterized upper bound for types `X`, `T` with free type parameters only on the first level and
  *           with concrete (or instantiated by the inferer) bounds, for example `Generic[X]`.
