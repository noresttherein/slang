/** A boxed `@volatile` variable of type `T`. Volatile declaration allows it to be used concurrently, guaranteeing
  * that changes will become visible to other threads, although no operations are atomic.
  * This makes it useful primarily as assigned-once variables.
  * This includes flags such as 'terminate thread' or lazily assigned values, where all assignments
  * are assumed to change it to the same value. Volatile variables incur lower overhead than full
  * java monitor synchronization, particularly with multiple concurrent reads.
  * If atomicity is required however, use [[SyncVar]] instead.
